# OS Relay Modules Manual

![](all.png)

## Introduction

This document describes the OS relay modules used in Open Source Model
Railway Electronics projects: - **OS-General-Purpose-Relay** (dual relay
module) - **OS-Latching-Relay** (single bistable relay module)

Both relay types exist in **THT** and **SMD** versions and can be
plugged directly into OS decoders or be used standalone.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 1. OS-General-Purpose-Relay

The OS-General-Purpose-Relay module contains **two mono stable relays**,
each with: - **1× Common (COM)** - **1× Normally Open (NO)** - **1×
Normally Closed (NC)**

### Features

-   Compatible with **OS-Solenoid-Decoder** and **OS-Servo-Decoder**
-   Suitable for:
    -   Accessory switching (lights, signals, animations)
    -   **Electrofrog** turnout frog polarization
    -   **Unifrog** turnout frog polarization
    -   **Power routing sidings**

### Example Use Cases

-   Switching power to isolated track sections
-   Creating automated frog polarity switching
-   Controlling external electronics such as LEDs, bells, or motors
-   Power‑routing turnout configurations

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 2. OS-Latching-Relay

The OS-Latching-Relay is a **single bistable (latching) relay**.\
It **remains in its last position without continuous power**.

### Important Notes

-   Cannot be used for **electrofrog** turnouts\
    (electrofrog requires a continuous, non‑latching polarity change)
-   Works perfectly with **unifrog** turnouts
-   The relay coil can be connected **in parallel** with the turnout
    solenoid coil, it does not require extra decoders

### Use Cases with DCC Decoders

-   **Unifrog frog polarization**
-   Self‑thinking turnouts / power‑routing
-   Accessory switching
-   Standalone operation with any solenoid decoder

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 3. Using the Relays with OS Decoders

### With OS-Solenoid-Decoder

-   Supports both:
    -   OS-General-Purpose-Relay\
    -   OS-Latching-Relay (for unifrog only)



### With OS-Servo-Decoder

-   Supports only:
    -   **OS-General-Purpose-Relay**
-   Typical uses:
    -   Frog polarity switching
    -   Accessory switching



------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 4. Standalone Usage

Both relay modules can be used without OS decoders.

### Requirements

-   A 5V logic-level control signal
-   Power supply appropriate to the relay type
-   Any microcontroller, Arduino, or third‑party decoder capable of
    driving a small relay

### Typical Standalone Applications

-   Switching LEDs or signals
-   Power routing in sidings
-   Controlling frog polarity in turnout modules
-   Low‑current automation tasks

## 5. Additional PCB ordering instructions

All OS-Relays have been designed so they can be ordered in so called panels. When they are ordered in panels, they have the same distances as the OS-decoder sockets. The PCBs can also be ordered as loose separated units, but as panels the PCBs are cheaper per unit.

To order them as a panel. You need to click on **Panel by JLCPCB** behind **Delivery format**. This will open a new window where you have to set the amount of colomns and rows. There are 2 rules:

- JLCPCB demands that panels need to be bigger than 70x70mm, the relays are around 50mm long and 15mm wide. 
- If they are to be used in combination with OS Solenoid or servo decoders. You want to have groups of 4 units, though this is not mandatory.

To meet the first demand you need atleast panels of 2 rows and 5 columns. To meet the second demand I recommend to increase to 8 colums. This essentially gives you 4 sets.

Whether you should order panels or loose PCBs also depends on how much you want. The minimum order amount is 5 units. So this can be 5 relays or it can be 5 panels of 10 - 16 relay modules each. You can always examine the price with shipping in the last cost, before paying. So you can stop your order at anytime.
